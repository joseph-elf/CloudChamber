# Cloud Chamber

My goal is to construct a cloud chamber running on peltier modules, and using magnetic field, to estimate the Q/M ratio.
I use 8 TEC1-12706, 4 on 12v and 4 or 6v to cool an aluminium plate. Watercooling cool the bottom side of peltier modules. 
Inside a glass box, isopropanol alcohol is injected and a stable gradient of temperature is achieved.
Some ouraline glass is placed and some trace are visible.

### First Results
I manage to obtain a good fog :

Some particles, probably Alpha and Beta are visible ( result are nor yet impressive...) :

### Issues
I don't manage to keep the -30Â°C needed for the experiment, I probably have to tune the power given to peltier modules and to improve my watercooling. 

Also, the light system seems to be very important for the visualisation.
